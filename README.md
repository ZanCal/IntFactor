Problem: What is the best way to find all factor pairs of a given int without using decimals at any point while minimizing the flop count?

What's included: 
  A baseline algorithm that manually checks each pair of integers less than and including the given integer to see which ones when multiplied are equal to the given integer 
  
  Several algorithms based on the baseline algorithm with one major change to them
  
  Several more algorithms where they combine ideas from the second set of algorithms
  
  Basic output of each algorithm, and their respective flop counts
